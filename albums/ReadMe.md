## Component Nesting : process of placing one component inside another.

# View : just like <div>

# Flex Box : system of positioning element in container

# justifyContents : positions elements in vetical direction                      (column is major axis).

# alignItems : positions items in horizontal direction (row                 is major axis)

# props (properties) : it is an object which is passed from                        parent(root) component to child                             component.

# Functional Component : Used for presenting static data.                            Can't handle fetching data. Easy                            to write .

# Class Based Component : Used for dynamic sources of data.                           Handles any data that might                                 change (events, fetch data etc) .
## LifeCycle Methods : 

# i. componentWillMount() : it will be executed as soon as                              this component is about to be                               rendered on screen.

# Component State :  a plain js object used to record and                        respond to user-triggered events. Used                      for only class based component.

# this.setState() : used to update component state with new                     data.

# note : props are for interection b/w parent and child .            state is for internal record keeping of components.
